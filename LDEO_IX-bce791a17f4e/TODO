=Known Bugs=

-Oct 18, 2010, IX_6-

Description: When the up- and downlooker data files are switched, the
code does not work cleanly as apparent in the figs (e.g. fig. 14) and
evidenced by the fact that BT does not work. 

Workaround: Don't switch the data files.

Severity: Low.


-Apr 14, 2011, IX_6-

Description, as reported by David Smeed: When processing data with
Matlab 2009a and printing on A4 paper some plots extend off the paper.

Workaround, as reported by David: changing "print -dpsc" to  "print
-depsc" in "process_cast.m"

Severity: Medium.


-Apr 14, 2011, IX_6-

Description, as reported by David Smeed: Cast end position is
incorrectly assumed at 0N 0W when cast is processed with GPS but no CTD
data.

Workaround: don't process LADCP data without CTD

Severity: Low.

=Possible Improvements=


- change all (mag)dev to magdecl (scripts, variables, log-file output,
  howto)

- add Fig.11 warnings when a data set the name of which is specified is not
  used

- remove most of the diagnostic output
