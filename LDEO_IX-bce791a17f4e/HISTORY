IX_3: (REPORTED VERSION IS IX_2!!!!)
    May 18, 2006:
        - implemented bugfix for PPI-filtering multi-ping ensembles
          provided by Mattew Alford [edit_data.m]
        - disabled edit_spike_filter by default
    Jul 19, 2006:
        - [m/besttlag.m] [mlocal/loadctd.m] added code to
          suppress new Matlab 7.2 warning of NaN values in interp1()
        - uploaded to website

IX_4:
    Jan  5, 2007:
        - updated version number
        - merged [mlocal/loadctd.m] from 2 older versions (one with bugs &
          one without support for elapsed time)
        - added support elapsed time-base to [mlocal/loadnav.m]
        - added Dan Torres' code for interpolating irregular GPS time
          series to [mlocal/loadnav.m]
        - added CTD & NAV file layouts to p structure
        - added [mlocal/mkSADCP.m] for pre-processing UH/CODAS-processed
          SADCP data 
        - fixed m/plotraw.m as suggested by Bruce Huber
        - uploaded to ftp site for CLIVAR I8S & Stan's AA cruise

IX_5:
    Jan 17, 2007:
        - updated version to 5beta
        - wrote [m/geomag.m] to use external program to calculate magnetic
          deviation
        - added support for [geomag.m] to [mlocal/loadnav.m]
        - emailed version to Dan Torres & Bruce Huber for beta testing
    Jan 26, 2007:
        - fixed BUG reported by Dan Torres regarding file-layout parameters
          (defaults were in structure p instead of f) [loadctd.m] [loadnav.m]
    Nov 18, 2007:
        - added 3-beam support to [loadrdi.m] 
    May 23, 2008:
        - improved [loadctd.m] to allow removing bad valued
          (f.ctd_badvals) & generate error if calculated sound
          velocities are complex (can happen with bad CTD spikes)
    Jun  4, 2008:
        - improved [cruise.m] & [htmltable.m] to allow for spaces in the
          cruise ID (they are now replaced by underscores)

        - fixed bug in [begin_processing_step.m] (typo that broke
          'eval-expr' code)
        - changed default of p.interp_ctd_times = 1; in [loadctd.m]
          because this does not affect already regularly spaced ctd time
          series but improves time matching of irregularly spaced ones
    Jun 27, 2008:
        - changed version from 5beta to 5
    Jun 30, 2008:
        - made [geomag.m] portable for non-UNIX OSs

    Jul  2, 2008:
        - removed m & mlocal subdirs
        - BUG: geomag code in [loadnav.m] required additional "" to
               allow spaces in the path of the IGRF coefficient file
        - removed inappropriate warning from [loadctd.m]

IX_6:
    Jul 17, 2008:
        - changed [default.m] to version IX_6beta
        - BUG: start/end positions were adjusted incorrectly at the end
               of [loadctd.m] when a large time adjustment was required
               (mainly with elapsed time base in case the ADCP was
               started significantly before the CTD); significant
               changes required in [loadnav.m] [loadctd.m] and
               also a small (untested) change in [loadctdprof.m]
    Jul 27, 2008:
        - [loadctdprof.m] [loadnav.m]: nanmean() -> meannan()
    Sep 18, 2008:
        - BUG: p.navdata was not set when f.nav was set to ' ', causing
               [loadctd.m] to bomb. Solution: set p.navdata to 0 in
               [process_cast.m]; some modification in
               [loadctd.m] required as well
    Oct  7, 2008:
        - extensively modified ProcFig. 3 in [geterr.m] to detect
          inconsistent up/downlooker data; also changed colormap

          DT bug fix 2009-01-07"
        - tighten use of exist() from simple true/false tests to test
          for specific return values; affected files [default.m]
          [dragmodel.m] [getdpthi.m] [getinv.m]
          [getkzprof.m] [getserial.m] [htmltable.m]
          [htmltable2.m] [loadctd.m] [loadctdprof.m]
          [loadnav.m] [loadrdi.m] [loadsadcp.m]
          [prepinv.m] [process_cast.m] [rditype.m]
          [savearch.m] [saveprot.m]; this bug fix was

IX_8gamma:
	Jan  6, 2012:
		- removed lesqchol() from getinv.m because it does not
		  deal well with (near-)singular matrices; while this is
		  somewhat iffy in the sense that the new code can produce trash

		  large velocities that are removed from the solutions, i.e. it
		  is hoped that this change does not confuse things
